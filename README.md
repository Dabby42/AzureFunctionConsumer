# Azure Function Consumer
The Azure Function Consumer is a .NET Core console app to consume Azure Functions. This program let's you send blobs, messages or documents to Azure resource which are bound to an Azure Function.  

There are Labs available [here][LINK1] that will walk you through the **creation** of  Azure Functions bound to numerous Azure products.  When you send data to an Azure product (i.e. Azure Blob Storage, Event Hub, Service Bus, etc.) that is bound to an Azure Function, the Azure Function is triggered and the code within your Azure Function is executed.

Sometimes the code doesn't work as expected, here are some labs which can help you learn how to **debug, troubleshoot and resolve** badly behaving Azure Functions issues.

The Azure Function consumer requires the dotnet runtime, which can be downoaded from [here][LINK2] and configured following the provided instructions.

To see which version of the .NET Core runtime you have installed, enter **dotnet --version**

The Azure Function Consumer currently supports sending data transmissions to:
+ Event Hub
+ Storage Queue
+ Blob Storage
+ Service Bus Queue
+ Cosmos DB
+ HTTP Trigger

## Download the Azure Function Consumer program ##
Download the AzureFunctionConsumer.dll and its dependencies from [here][LINK3].  Take the most current version.

## Examples ##
The following examples illustrate how to trigger an HTTP, an Event Hub, Storage Queue and an Azure Cosmos DB bound Azure Function
